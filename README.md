# Parse Tree Android Calculator

After creating a console parse tree calculator in java I decided why not turn this into an android app, so I did exactly that. I never made an android app before but since android apps are coded in java I was already half way there. If you take this code and run it in android studio it should work fine in the emulator and on an actual android phone. I tested this on an LG V20 running nouget.
